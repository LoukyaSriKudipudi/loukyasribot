Response: Here's a simple explanation of the Telugu text:

"The President has the power to grant pardons. He can reduce or cancel any punishment, including a death sentence. This is the power of judicial review."

In even simpler terms:
‚Ä¢ The President can forgive or lessen punishments for crimes.
‚Ä¢ This includes forgiving death penalties.
‚Ä¢ This power is part of how the justice system can be reviewed.
